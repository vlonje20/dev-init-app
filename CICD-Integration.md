  - Under 'Maven Version', select your preconfigured maven version.
  - Under 'Goals' write 'clean package' 
  - Now Save
  - Select 'Build Now'


# 3. Jenkins SonarQube Intergrations (Code Quality) 
  # On GitHub:  
  - Make sure your SonarQube Server is running 
  - Go to the Build Script (pom.xml) in the GitHub Repository
  - Go to 'Properties' and change the sonar.host.url (IP addressPort) and replace with the 
    right IP addressPort of your SonarQube Server. 
  - Commit the changes. 

     # On Jenkins:

  - Under 'Goal' write 'sonar:sonar'
  - Then Save 
  - Build Now    

# 4. Jenkins Tomcat Intergrations 
   cp *.war /var/lib/tomcat9/webapps   
 - We do this intergration using a plugin call 'Deploy to Container'  
 - In Jenkins go to Dashboard ==> Manage Jenkins ==> Manage Plugins ==> 
   Available ==> Search (Deploy to container)

 - Dashboard ==> Project ==> Configure ==> Post-Build-Action ==> Add Post-Build-Action ==> 
   Deploy war/ear to container ==>

 - Under 'Deploy war/ear to a container'
   target/*war

 # To create your tomcat credentials: 
 - On your terminal do the following: 

     sudo nano /etc/tomcat9/tomcat-users.xml 

 - Paste the following just above the </tomcat-users> closing.

     <user username="tomcat" password="admin123" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui"/>
     <user username="vin" password="admin123" roles="manager-gui,admin-gui,manager-script"/> 


# 6. Email Notification 
  - In Jenkins go to Dashboard --> Project --> Configure --> Post-Build-Action --> 
    Add Post-Build-Action --> Email Notification --> Emails --> Build Now  


Build Triggers: 
===============
- We use build triggers to automate the process.  
- Build Now          
  - This is a manual build 

- Build Periodically 
  - Jenkins uses a timer to trigger a build. 
    (***** build every minute) 
    (H**** build every hour) 
    (Best for Database backup)

- Poll SCM           
   - Jenkins trigger a build based on changes in the source codes. 
     (Generally Recommended) 
   - Jenkins pull the changes from GitHub.   

- GitHub Web Hook    
   - Jenkins do a build when there is any changes in the source code 
   (GitHub Account) 
   - GitHub push the changes to Jenkins.  
   - To configure = GitHub--> Project Repo--> Settings--> Webhooks-->  Add Webhook 
     Content type = (application/json)
     Payload URL = Paste the Jenkins URL with the extension github-webhook/ 
     (e.g. http://18.218.211.120:8080/github-webhook/)
